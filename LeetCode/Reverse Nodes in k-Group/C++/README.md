## Approach
1. First, we check if the input linked list 'head' is NULL or if 'k' is 1. If either of these conditions is met, there's no need to reverse the list, so we return the original 'head' as it is.
2. We create a dummy node at the beginning of the list to simplify the code. This dummy node's 'next' pointer is set to the original 'head'. This dummy node will serve as the new head of the reversed list after each group is reversed.
3. We initialize three pointers: 'curr', 'nex', and 'prev', all initially pointing to the dummy node. 'curr' will be used to traverse the current group of 'k' nodes, 'nex' will be used to keep track of the next node in the original list (i.e., the node following the current group), and 'prev' will be used to keep track of the last node of the previously reversed group.
4. We count the number of nodes in the linked list by traversing it with the 'curr' pointer. This count is stored in the 'count' variable.
5. We enter a loop that continues as long as we have 'k' or more nodes remaining to reverse. Inside this loop:
    - We use 'curr' to keep track of the first node in the current group.
    - We use 'nex' to keep track of the node following the current group.
        - We use a 'for' loop to reverse the 'k' nodes in the current group:
        - We update the 'next' pointers of 'curr', 'nex', and 'prev' to reverse the direction of the 'k' nodes.
        - We move 'nex' and 'curr' to their respective next nodes.
    - After reversing the 'k' nodes, we update 'prev' to point to the last node in the reversed group.
6. We decrement 'count' by 'k' since we have reversed 'k' nodes, and we continue the loop until we have less than 'k' nodes left to reverse.
7. Finally, we return the 'next' pointer of the dummy node, which is the new head of the reversed linked list.


## Intution 
The main idea behind this code is to reverse the linked list in groups of 'k'. To do this, we maintain three pointers: 'curr', 'nex', and 'prev'. 'curr' is used to traverse the current group, 'nex' keeps track of the node following the current group, and 'prev' points to the last node of the previously reversed group.

The process involves iteratively reversing 'k' nodes at a time by updating the 'next' pointers of these nodes in the reverse order. After reversing each group, we update 'prev' to point to the last node of that group, which will become the next 'prev' for the subsequent group.

The dummy node simplifies the code by serving as the new head of the reversed list, and we continue this process until we've reversed all groups of 'k' nodes or less. Finally, we return the new head of the reversed list.

This approach ensures that we reverse the list in groups of 'k' while preserving the order of nodes within each group and the overall order of the linked list.
